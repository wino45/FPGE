FPGE for windows 0.5.1 FAQ

1. Windows Vista or 7 64bit problems

There is no good solution for graphic problems with 64bit versions for Windows.
To use FPGE change graphic to "window mode":
* run FPGE
* press ctrl-g
* choose DirectDraw window + resolution that suits your need.

2. Compiling
The 0.5.0 has been compiled via Dev-C++. But I have switched to newer version of Allegro and EclipseCDT in version 0.5.1.
So the 0.5.1 is compiled using gcc-3.4.5, Allegro 4.2.2 (MINGW 5.1.6 package as of 2010.02) and EclipseCDT 20100218-1602.
The difference between Dev-C++ and EclipseCDT is Eclipse must be configured specialy to 
compile resource file (icon and version information).
I have used the following modification to project file:
* add RC_file variable in "Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Build variables"
  RC_file is set to..\src\FPGE_private.rc
* compile resource file "Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Build Step -> Pre-build steps"
  Command set to : windres -i "${RC_file}" -o src\resources.o
* link resources "Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Tool Settings -> MinGW C Linker -> Miscellaneous -> Other objects"
  Add ".\Release\src\resources.o"
  
3. RIMP, REXP what they load/save
Using this function you will load/save only one layer : tile layer - the graphical represenation of the map.
Recreate road layer, terrain layer or names layer by using CTRL-Q generation algorithms.

Q: How to compile FPGE.

A: To compile FPGE you need DJGPP (http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/) compiler and tools. The version of the compiler I used is very old. I was able to compile FPGE using the folowing DJGPP packages:

Most of them are downloaded from http://www.ludd.luth.se/~ams/djgpp/
see file : http://djgpp.linux-mirror.org/deleted/v2gnu/gcc2721.txt

Install DJGPP (unzip and set PATH and DJGPP system variables).

To complie allegro:
make mmxtest
make
make install

Compiling FPGE works directly from Windows XP command prompt. Just run build.bat
