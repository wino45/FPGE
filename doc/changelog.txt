Check:
*
Save as in pgf mode save to AG, without equipment name
*
Converted PG2 PGCAM listed arract.pgscn but FPGE converted arract.scn as 000.pgscn. 
*
There is a package of 57 Jordi AG scenarios, each scenario in a uniquely named zipped folder but the scenario
 files use the same filenames (game002.scn, some with map02.set and map02.stm). It is possible to rename the 
 converted files and internally text/hex-edit manually (Cassino as cassi.pgscn, cassi.set, cassi.stm). Could 
 FPGE do batch conversions to unzip, convert, and rename/edit to unique filenames (either the first 5 letters of 
 the folder name, which still might require some manual preparation to avoid conflicts, or sequential numbers) in
  the main directory?  
  
- What I can do is to add dialog with covert options for LGeneral map export : use PG tile to LG terrain type (as now) or use PG terrain type to LG terrain type (new one).
- LGEN: strenght bmp,  campaign (path+ brefings)
- PacGen country conversion in case of PG/PGF/AG modes-do we need this ?
- PacGen units names
- new PGF map from scratch - save as ...
- PGDOS map different then SCN -Woolf campaign
- check if deployment fields are empty !
- check number of deploy field vs size of the core.
- when changing map size change victory points, deploy, neutral, etc
- show which country can buy given unit (?)
- unit list - limits
- alt-i show wrong rivers
- alt-o check if all ocean is named
- alt-u check units
- alt-v check flags - cites owners versus sides
- alt-left, alt-right -go to next problem
- all keyboard shortcuts must be listed in one file
- road connections edit same as in XWG
- SAVE AS- ask scenario number when scenario==0
- don't load not needed resources on startup, change startup and command line parsing sequences
- faster loading of unit icons- check icon sizes for each file
- save units in order proposed by Pepa
- Analyze palette usage- show all colors used by tacicons and tacmap (?)
- undo - basic, limited number of levels, tiles only
- radius in terrain (?)
  Road generation:
- treat end of map as road when making road connections
- road generation special case = road parallel to the city
- road generation changes, Pepa's case: PacPG1, hexes (16,9) and (17,9)
