FPGE for Windows
Version 0.5.1

Installation

Copy FPGE.exe to DAT directory of the PG game, then run it.

Introduction

This my modded version of FPGE. Read "fpge01.txt" file first ! Since version 0.4.1 FPGE is a native Windows application. No more DOSbox and CWSDPMI.

Some most important new features of the version 0.5.0 are here (full changelog below):
* Support for many graphical modes - use direct X accel modes for the best results
* FPGE is saving config file, so each time you start you got same visual information displayed. Use crtl-i to reset visuals to default
* Search and Replace function - great in naming oceans
* advanced terrain function - change tile only when is matching some criteria. Also great in naming oceans and rivers. Hint - use this feature : choose desired tile attributes and matching criteria, then left click first tile, then left click with shift key pressed to change all matching tiles in rectangle.
* command line options to:
- search of common errors in maps
- save BMP file with map (big, full of details) and small map (strategic map)
- list units or scenario parameters to console
Hint : command line listings or bmp file generation can be used for quick building of the web pages or wikis. 

Use HELP button to read about all active hot keys in FPGE (over 35 of them are now active)

Start cmd.exe, navigate to DAT directory, run FPGE -h to check possible command line switches.
Example below:

Usage : fpge [option] XX
where XX is map number

Only one of following command line switches will be recognized at each program run:
* Save BMP options:
-B[nyrlizgatu{0123}{56}{dhf}{sexc}{mwo}{pvq@}] save BMP and exit.
  Config is loaded before saving bmp.
  Use any modifier to skip loading configuration. Default is 'g0so'. Modifiers:
  Use any of : n-all names     y-draw terrain  r-draw roads       z-override unit hiding
  Use any of : i-hide map hex grid l-toggle unit org. transport (will work for 'gt' only)
  Use any of : ^-scenario units counters mode  $-draw all units   #-override flags hiding
  Use any of : j-show units ID in the scenario.
  Use one of : g-ground units  a-air units     t-transport units  u-no units
  Use one of : 0-no names      1-non trivial   2-non river        3-river names
  Use one of : 5-axis spotting 6-allied spotting
  Use one of : d-show decimal  h-show hex      f-show full names
  Use one of : s-show strength e-show ent      x-show experience  c-no unit counters
  Use one of : o-normal tiles  m-mud tiles     w-winter tiles
  Use one of : p-deployment    v-victory mode  q-neutral mode     @-all of them
  Usage of any of modifiers 'nyr123' will hide all units icons unless 'z' is specified.
  Example: 'fpge -Br1f 01' will draw bmp file with roads, non trivial names, display full names.
* Display information options:
-N display all names used in scenario.
-U[d] list units. Use 'd' to display IDs
-C list all cities.
-A[s] display tile name used in map, one line per tile.
-T[s] display tile type used in map, one line per tile.
  For -A and -T use 's' modifier to skip lines with not used tiles in current map: -Ap -Tp.
-S show scenario information.
-O show names and all tiles type for each name.
-M[v{gan}{mwo}{56}{al}] saves strategic map bmp. Modifiers:
  Use one of : g-ground units  a-air units     u-no units
